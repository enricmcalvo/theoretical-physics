The Theoretical Physics Reference is an attempt to derive all theoretical
physics equations (that are ever needed for applications) from the general
and special relativity and the standard model of particle physics.

The goals are:

* All calculations are very explicit, with no intermediate steps left out.
* Start from the most general (and correct) physical theories (general
  relativity or standard model) and derive the specialized equations from them
  (e.g. the Schr√∂dinger equation).
* Math is developed in the math section (not in the physics section).
* Theory should be presented as short and as explicitly
  as possible. Then there should be arbitrary number of examples, to show how
  the theory is used.
* There should be just one notation used throughout the book.
* It should serve as a reference to any physics equation (exact derivation
  where it comes from) and the reader should be able to understand how things
  work from this book, and be ready to understand specialized literature.


This is a work in progress and some chapters don't conform to the above goals
yet. Usually first some derivation is written, as we understood it, then the
mathematical tools are extracted and put into the math section, and the rest is
fit where it belongs. Sometimes we don't understand some parts yet, then those
are currently left there as they are.
